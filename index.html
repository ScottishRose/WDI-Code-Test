    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>Born on the east coast and raised on the west coast, I'm a natural born maker, creator, adventurer, learner and dog lover! </p>
    
    <p>From a young age, I always had a camera and was taking pictures of everything! I was always told that I had a natural &#39eye&#39 for good composition and spent most of my teen years in the photo lab. If you couldn't find me in the darkroom, you could find me painting or drawing in the art room! It is in high school that I also found a love of film, which I would later explore.</p>

    <p>With the advice of a great mentor, I attended an art school in the Bay Area to get my BFA in Photography. After graduation, I moved to work as a freelance photographer in New York City. But, much to my dismay, my heart never left the west coast and I soon moved back home to pursue other adventures.</p>

    <p>Soon after, after much thought, I decided to pursue a Master's degree in film and after much hard work (and many headaches!) I attended a University in England. After the course I returned to California and worked full-time as a dog walker and pet sitter.</p>

    <p>After a year-long job search, with not much luck, I accepted a job in New York City and 2 weeks later headed back to the east coast!</p>

    <p>I have now been back in New York City for a little more than a year. The opportunity to move back has brought so much self growth and reflection. I also adopted an awesome little dog! I am still trying to figure out how I can incorporate everything that I love into a fulfilling career including crafts/DIY, photography, film editing, animal rescue, coding -- to name a few. I now have a new dream that I am chasing and with the help of General Assembly, I hope to set myself up to acheive it!</p>
